**LUIS MENDEZ**

# Classification

## SILVER

1. **Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?**
*The main advantage of these programming languages ​​is that they can use the programming paradigms.*

2. **What is machine code?**
*It is the language that computers and other computing systems can execute.*

3. **Give an example of a high-level language?**
*Java.*

## GOLD

1. **Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?**
*High-level languages ​​are often only used on select operating systems, high-level languages ​​are useful when we want to manipulate something from the operating system; low-level systems are closer to the hardware of the computer equipment.*

2. **What does a translator do?**
*It is responsible for transforming the programming language to machine language.*

3. **Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?**
*Interpreters and compilers.*

## PLATINUM
1. **What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?**
*Interpreter facilitates the search for errors since the execution can be interrupted at any time; compiler usually generates faster and more efficient programs since the source language analysis is done only once*

2. **What is assembly language?**
*It consists of a low-level programming language, It implements the symbolic representation of the codes of
the machine binaries and other constants necessary to program a processor architecture.*

3. **A developer is writing a program.**
**a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code?**
*High-level language is that it more closely resembles natural language,
machine language are instructions that the processor can understand directly without going through a compiler / interpreter.*

**b) One type of translator is an interpreter.**
- **i) Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?**
- **ii) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?**

*Interpreter translates all source code into machine code one command / line at a time, and immediately executes it afterwards. The interpreter must be installed to run the software.*
